Task 0
    Write a Python script that, using this REST API, for a given employee ID, returns information about his/her TODO list progress.

NB: The endpoint for access specific TODO items for an employee with ID = 1 will be https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1/todos and the endpoint to get specific employee details will be https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1

Requirements:

    You must use urllib or requests module
    The script must accept an integer as a parameter, which is the employee ID
    The script must display on the standard output the employee TODO list progress in this exact format:
        First line: Employee EMPLOYEE_NAME is done with tasks(NUMBER_OF_DONE_TASKS/TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_TASKS):
            where:
            EMPLOYEE_NAME: name of the employee
            NUMBER_OF_DONE_TASKS: number of completed tasks
            TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_TASKS: total number of tasks, which is the sum of completed and non-completed tasks
        Second and N next lines display the title of completed tasks: TASK_TITLE (with 1 tabulation and 1 space before the TASK_TITLE)
Task 1
